\section{Abstruct}

    Makerere University is one of the best institutions of learning in Africa. It being among the best it takes a close looks at her environment.
This is done by planting different tree species, grass and flowers, but this research is mainly about the tree species planted.

\section{Introduction}

    Makerere University was established in 1921, and during those early days of its start, it had a poor environment setting and according to prof.Behayo Hillary, this was due to low funds and inadequate knowledge about environment conservation by then.
But it is evident that some of these challenges have been swayed away with time.
